Features:
* Any number of translations (no hard limit, only saving/loading time increases)
* Id And contents binding (loading different version identifies strings and projects changes to translations accordingly)
* Automatic update checking (can be disabled)
* Export/Import to/from excel spreadsheet (for further custom processing and whatnot)
* Self update (automatic download & replacement)

Support:
* Unprotected maps
* Maps generated by EUD editor (using some guard)
* idk probably a lot of other stuff

I didn't get samples of many tool output maps, so if you find a map that is not supported by this tool, please create an issue.
\
It's still BETA and not thoroughly tested, so always have a backup of your maps before using this tool.
\
**It*s not recommented to output to input map** (stuff breaks, translation corrupts and whatnot).
\
If you want to translate this tool to another language, translate [these strings](https://github.com/Tarferi/Starcraft-Translation-Tool/blob/master/lng_en.txt) (the parts after the equals sign)
